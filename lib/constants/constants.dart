export './appwrite_constants.dart';

// You can now simply import the constants.dart file throughout 
// your project
// and have access to all the constants across the application. 
// It simplifies the import process and provides a centralized 
// place to manage and reuse the constants

// This technique will also prevent you from having multiple
// imports in the dart files.
// It's like you are grouping together related files in one name.
// You can now just say "import 'constansts.dart'"
