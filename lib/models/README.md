# Models

This folder contains model files representing different entities used in the event planning and management system.

- `event.dart`: Defines the structure of an event object.
- `user.dart`: Represents the structure of a user object.

## Explanation
The models in the Models folder are defined as Dart classes that represent different entities used in the event planning and management system. 
- For example, the `event.dart` file defines an Event class that has properties such as title, description, location, date, and time. These properties define the structure of an event object and can be used to store and retrieve information about an event.
- Similarly, the `user.dart` file defines a User class that has properties such as name, email, password, and phoneNumber. These properties define the structure of a user object and can be used to store and retrieve information about a user.
